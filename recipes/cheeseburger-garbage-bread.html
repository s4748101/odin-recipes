    <h2>Cheeseburger Garbage Bread Description</h2>
    <p>This cheeseburger garbage bread is absolutely perfect for when you’re having a party. Garbage bread is what we used to call stromboli, and it’s so versatile because you basically can throw anything in it and it will taste amazing. Here, all the elements of a bacon cheeseburger, right down to the dill pickle, are rolled in thin pizza dough, baked until golden brown, and sliced into gorgeous spirals. It's great as-is, but we're including an optional secret sauce recipe to serve alongside.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup diced red onion</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>8 ounces Cheddar cheese, shredded, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced dill pickle or relish</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon over medium heat in a nonstick skillet until crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain bacon on a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Do not wipe out the pan.</li>
        <li>Add onions and pinch of salt to the pan with the bacon grease, and turn heat to medium-high. Sauté until onions soften up and start to take on golden-brown color, 3 to 4 minutes. Add beef; cook, breaking up the meat with a spatula up into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir salt, freshly ground black pepper, cayenne, and Worcestershire sauce into the beef; continue to cook until beef is browned and any liquid in the pan has evaporated.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Stir in reserved bacon, 2 tablespoons ketchup, 1 tablespoon mustard, and 1/2 the shredded Cheddar cheese. Let mixture cool to room temperature before using, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Using only as much flour as needed, press, roll and stretch pizza dough out into a 10x15-inch rectangle.</li>
    </ol>
